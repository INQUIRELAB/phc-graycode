# phc-graycode
This repository contains simulation files and documentation for a high-efficiency two-bit binary-to-Gray code converter using 2D photonic crystal waveguides. The design supports dual functionality as a reversible Feynman logic gate, optimized for photonic integrated circuits and binary neural networks.
